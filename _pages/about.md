Hey! I'm Philip. I'm a guy who writes code and thinks about things. Sometimes
it makes sense to write those thoughts down. Sometimes it doesn't. For your
sake, I hope that I have the foresight to know the difference, but I wouldn't
hold my breath.

Sometimes I write code for other people. My opinions and what I write here
shouldn't be thought of as a reflection of the values of those people. These
are my own thoughts and musings.

So the entire month has gotten away from me. I don't know how I just realized
that.

On the plus side, I now have an enormous amount of respect now for people who
write highly techincal blog posts. That shit is hard! But I like hard problems.

I'm definitely going to try and keep producing high quality technical content.
That is just good learning. It seems obvious to me now though that I need havea
habitual time that I write. I need to produce content frequently enough that I
don't just up and lose a whole month.

It happens to be a Sunday, and I happen to be writing! So I think I'll try and
make that a habit. If I don't work on producing a technical post, at the very
least I can write something. Perhaps that will be the trigger that gets my
juices flowing!

I feel a bit like I'm discovering something that is already common knowledge to
people who do this more. I suppose that's kind of the point though.

We need to parse the list down to a single number, but instead of looking at the most common bit to keep that bit, we're going to look at the most/least common bit and keep all the numbers. This process will then be applied to this new, shorter list. There are two values that we want to produce this way: `og_rating` and `cs_rating`.

However, it does strike me that you might be able to compose a list that doesn't get reduced to a single value in the course of applying this rule. I wonder what that might look like? What are the limits on the size of the list vs the size of it's elements such that you might be able to guarantee a value is generated?\n",

Thankfully, the input here is small, so I can just iterate the numbers to create a new list based on the knowledge of what the most common things are.

    "Ok, so this _looks_ really nice, but what immediately jumps out to me is that `apply_iterative_rule` depends on the rule actually reducing the list to a given value. That is, we can pass a perfectly operational rule to the function, and it will simply never terminate.\n",
    "\n",
    "How could we avoid this? The simplest way I can think is to pass in a limit to the function. Something like:\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "def apply_iterative_rule(ls, rule, limit):\n",
    "    ls_copy = ls.copy()\n",
    "    iteration = 0\n",
    "    while len(ls_copy) > limit:\n",
    "        ls_copy = rule(list_copy, iteration)\n",
    "        iteration += 1\n",
    "    return ls_copy[0]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to pass in the rule, and some expectation about it. But is there actually any guarantee that we'll terminate? It depends on the rule. Since the rule itself is decoupled from this, it feels risky to me. Essentially, we need a way to guarantee that all the rules that we pass in will decrease...\n",
    "\n",
    "I don't really know how one might do that. This is why I prefer stopping at the prior step. We generalized just enough to clean up the code and isolate the \"business logic\" of which thing we wanted to keep. We also kept the filtration logic visible within the loop that controls it. That means that we can, just by looking at the `get_rating_hof` function, be relatively sure that we'll terminate.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "This was a fun one. It gave me a chance to use partials again, and I'm a huge fan of higher order functions. It feels like there may be a more general solution, but we will always sacrifice efficiency. On that note, it also seems like there is probably a pretty clever way to solve this in a super efficient way using some [evil bit-level hacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_inverse_square_root). I don't generally go in for that. The code solves the problem, and it does so quickly enough for me to write it up.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will, however, come back to the topic of termination. I feel like looking at the rules we're applying vs the input we take in is interesting enough to warrant that. As it is, our solution seems to depend on the fact that we're playing a game that must have a solution. In the real world, being able to tell if the data won't terminate is pretty valuable. I'll try to remember to update with a link to that when the time comes."
